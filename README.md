# Node.Js-Notes 
<hr>
# Key Points:
- Runtime  environment <br>
- Cross-Platform <br>
- Server-side application <br>
- NPM <br>
- Scalability <br>
- Event loop-Single threaded <br>
- Event driven & Asychronous <br>

# Advantages of node.js
- Runtime environment <br>
- Large ecosystem(npm) <br>
- scalable <br>
- High Perfomace <br>
- Cross platform <br>
- Fast execution <br>
- Non-blocking 

 # Disadvantages of node.js 
 - single threaded <br>
 - callback hell <br>
 - security concerns <br>
 - Debugging and tooling <br>
 - Limited CPU utilization

# Runtime Environment 
- The runtime provide a environment where javascrit code is executed outside the browser.<br>
- In the case of Node.js, this environment is typically on a server or a local machine rather than in a browser window. This environment includes features like the ability to interact with the file system, access network resources, and perform other tasks typically associated with server-side programming.

# v8 engine 
- Node.js is build on the top of v8 javascript engine , developed by Google. <br>
- It is responsible for parsing and executing javascript code . <br>
- It include just-in-time (JIT) compiler that convert js code into machine code for faster execution . This is the one reason for high performace.
